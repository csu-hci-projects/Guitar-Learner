To run this app, download Expo Go on the iOS app store with an iOS device. Since I built this app using React Native, you could probably do this on an Android device as well, but I don't have one so I'm not sure.

Then, clone this project to VSCode or whatever text editor you use. In the terminal, run 'npm start'

From here, a QR code appears in the terminal. Scan the QR code with your iOS device, and Expo Go will open. Now, you can use the app and navigate as you please.

To stop the execution of the app, simply click 'control + c'
